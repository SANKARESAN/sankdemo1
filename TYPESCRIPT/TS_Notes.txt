# TYPESCRIPT :-

--> It is super set of javascript.
--> it is compile language.
--> it is strict typed language.



# How to know ts is available or not
# How to install TYPESCRIPT

# cmd -1 --> TO INSTALL TYPESCRIPT --> npm i -g typescript
 
tsc -v   --> CHECK TYPESCRIPT VERSION.       

npx tsc -v -->  After not recognized 


# How to execute typescript file ?
1--> tsc fileName.ts     // complete ts file and create on plain js file... //  npx tsc demo.ts

2--> node fileName.js // to execute js file...



# variable declaration in TS ?
# data-type in TS ?

1. TASK : write one parameterize func is TS which wll take two parameter and display your FullName ?

2. TASK : write a parameterize func, which will return area of circle passing radius values as parameter ?

# OOPS :

-->  1. class : it is collection of data member and member-function.
              : its template of which we can re-use.
              : to create class we use class keyword.


-->  2. object : it is an instance of class.
              : it allows us to access class data-member  and member- func outside class,.

syntax : let objName = new ClassName()



# CONSTRUCTOR: 
--> It is special member func of class.
--> it will execute automatically when class object get created (or) initialize.
--> in ts construction name must only be constructor.

# 3. INHERITANCE:-

--> accessing parent class property into child class.
--> to perform inheritance in between classes we use extends keywords.


# super() :

--> it represent parent class constructor insode child class constructor.
--> super method must be first statement in child class constructor.



# 4. ENCAPSULATION :
--> wrapping of data into single unit.

--> public :    we can access class property inside and outside as well as in derived(child) class.
--> protected : we can access class property inside same class as well as in derived(child) class.
--> private :   we can access class property inside same class only.





# 5. ABSTRACTION :
--> hiding implementations and showing necessary information .
--> we can achieve this by using interface, abstract class.




# 6. POLYMORPHISM      : It is ability to take more than one form. 
--> method overloading : when we have multiple method with same name in same class.
--> method overriding  : when we have multiple method with same name in different class.



# MODULE : 

--> writing ts code in single or mulptiple file and access it in another file.
--> to achieve this we use export and import keyword.
--> to send data we use export to access it we use import.



# INTERFACE:

--> It is signature of class
--> it contain abstract method
--> to create interface we use interface keyword
--> its child class has responsibility to implement it. 
--> to implement interface we use implement keyword.
